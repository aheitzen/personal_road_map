				<div>Hi! Thanks for checking out this project. Starting from the beginning, I was born and raised in Long Beach, CA.<br> My Mom worked as a special education teacher and my Dad worked in the metals industry. They are both retired now.<br> I attended school at the University of CA, Irvine where I received my B.A. in Psychology. <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> </div>

				<div>I flirted with different careers over 3 years and finally came to the realization I wanted to work in a creative capacity.<br> I have never been much of an artist, but digital and web design resonated with me.<br> I hope to work in an environment that is both technical and creative. <i class="fa fa-bolt" aria-hidden="true"></i> </div>

				<div>I should also mention that I think Seattle is the best city in the world.<br> My partner and I moved here over a year and a half ago and cannot get enough of this wonderful city. <br>Our top hobbies include paddleboard/kayaking, drinking coffee and riding our bikes. <i class="fa fa-bicycle" aria-hidden="true"></i></div>

				<div>I love biking, paddle boarding, swimming, running, and dancing. <i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true"></i><br>I love video games. Some of my favorites include the Final Fantasy series, Until Dawn, and Life is Strange.<br> I also love playing board games. My favorites include Coup, Above and Below, Elder Sign, and Dixit to name a few.</div>

				<div>Extra fun facts about me! I have gone skydiving, parasailing, and trapezing (is that a word?).<br> I LOVE cats. I have probably spent hundreds of dollars at Seattle Meowtropolitan.<br> I go in hard during Halloween. It's the best holiday in my book. <i class="fa fa-snapchat-ghost" aria-hidden="true"></i> </div>
